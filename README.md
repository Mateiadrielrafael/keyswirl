# Welcome to KeySwirl

This is my repository for lots of keyboard related things!

| Name                         | Description                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [keyboards](./keyboards/qmk) | qmk configurations for my keyboards |
| [layout-lens](./layout-lens) | keyboard layout to SVG renderer     |

Some neat thingies:

- This repository provides a nix flake for devshells and builds.
- Each keyboard contains a `lens.json` which automatically generates a prevew in CI!
